</h2>
					<p>Hundreds of islands dot the coastline of Ireland, each one offering something very unique. From the wild adventures of pirate queens and one-eyed warrior kings to surprising appearances of wild wallabies or a tropical lagoon in Irish waters, these islands can give you an otherworldly experience.  </p>
					<h2>Tory Island, Donegal</h2>
					<p>Tory Island is the most remote of all the islands of Ireland. With a population of roughly 150 people, one hotel and a handful of B&Bs, the buzz of city life will fade away quickly here, with the feeling of bygone days taking its place. As part of Donegal’s Gaeltacht region, Irish is the first language here but English is also spoken. </p>
					<p>Tory is a swimmer's and diver's dream. It's highly recommended you go for a dip at the harbour or book in a diving session with Mevagh Dive Centre to investigate the wreck of the HMS Wasp, a Royal Navy gunboat whose crew was en route to evict poor tenant families in 1884. It’s said that the island’s Neolithic cursing stone, Cloch na Mallacht, was used to steer the ship off course and meet its untimely end. </p>
					<p>Tory Island is rich in folklore, with Balor, the one-eyed warrior king of the Irish mythological superrace, the Fomorians, ruling there. On the east coast of the island, the ruins of his fort (Dún Balor) look out across the Atlantic Ocean and from here, you can see An Eochair Mhór (the big key), a long spur that juts out from a peninsula, forming An Tor Mór (the big rock), where Balor imprisoned his daughter to prevent her from getting pregnant. The locals also have a long-standing tradition of choosing a king to represent them; the last King of Tory passed away in October 2018. </p>
					<h2>Clare Island, Mayo</h2>
					<p>Mayo’s Clew Bay is said to have 365 islands - one for each day of the year - but, in reality, it has 117 and Clare Island is the largest. With hills and mountains filled with historical sites and a Blue Flag beach, it’s perfect for outdoor activities. </p>
					<p>Macalla Farm is a family-run retreat centre that combines yoga, horses, food and mindfulness. Taking place on a working farm, most of the food is produced on site, with vegetarian meals available to guests throughout their stay. Across the island, there’s a number of walking and hiking routes that will knock the cobwebs out of your head. Two of the most popular are Clew Bay Archaeological Trail, which includes stop offs at the 13-15th century abbey and a megalithic court tomb, and the Knocknaveena Loop, taking you up and around the Knocknaveen Mountain.</p>
					<p>But it wasn’t always so peaceful here. Clare Island is the ancestral home of Gráinne Mhaoil, Ireland’s most fearsome and legendary Pirate Queen. Notorious for wreaking havoc at sea for most of the 16th century, her castle here was used to control the waters of Clew Bay and you can still visit it today. </p>
					<p>Today there’s plenty to do at nighttime, with the two pubs regularly putting on trad nights as entertainment, balancing the calm of the retreat with the storm of the session. </p>
					<p>Get there: It takes approximately 25 minutes to get to Clare Island by ferry from Roonagh Pier, Co. Mayo. You can book ferry tickets from either Clare Island Ferry Co. or O’Malley Ferries. </p>
					<h2>Lambay Island, Dublin</h2>
					<p>Located just four kilometres off the coast of Co. Dublin, Lambay Island is privately owned with a population of seven people, 100 red-necked wallabies, 200 fallow deer and thousands of seabirds. Owned by the Barings family since 1904,  there’s an air of luxury due to the restricted accommodation that’s available throughout the year. </p>
					<p>With 23 rooms in total on the island, only guests who have an existing connection to Lambay can stay in the renovated 15th century castle or the White House.  The rest of us can request to stay in O’Connell’s Cottage, which sits at the end of a row of 18th century coastguard cottages and sleeps six people. If you fail to nab a bed, day tours are available, with options to go on walking and historical tours or simply to visit for lunch. </p>
					<p>Throughout the year, various retreats are on offer including yoga, writing, foraging and cooking.  The water from the island’s natural spring is not only used for drinking, washing, cooking and bathing but it’s also used to create the island’s own Lambay Whiskey.</p>
					<p>Get there: The ferry takes 15-30 minutes from Malahide and you can book tickets from Skerries Sea Tours or find out about staying on the island here.</p>
